            <p>
                Welcome to <strong>Paws in Stride</strong>, where we believe that every dog deserves a safe, fun, and engaging walk. 
                My name is Greg Saint and I’ve been a dog owner for over 15 years. I’m the proud pet parent of a lovable Shihpoo 
                named Chi, who enjoys nothing more than a good walk and a game of fetch. Having lived in Frisco, Texas for the past 12 years, 
                I’ve grown to love this community and understand the importance of finding reliable care for our furry friends. That’s why 
                I started Paws in Stride. Our goal is to provide exceptional dog walking services that keep both dogs and their owners happy.

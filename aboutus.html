        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>Paws in Stride</strong>, where we believe that every dog deserves a safe, fun, and engaging walk. My name is Greg Saint and I’ve been a dog owner for over 15 years. I’m the proud pet parent of a lovable Shihpoo named Chi, who enjoys nothing more than a good walk and a game of fetch.</p>
        <p>Having lived in Frisco, Texas for the past 12 years, I’ve grown to love this community and understand the importance of finding reliable care for our furry friends. That’s why I started Paws in Stride. Our goal is to provide exceptional dog walking services that keep both dogs and their owners happy.</p>

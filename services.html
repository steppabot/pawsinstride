        <h2>Dog Walking Services</h2>
        <p>
            At Paws in Stride, we provide dog walking services tailored to fit your dog's energy level and your schedule.
            Each walk is designed to ensure your dog gets the exercise and attention they need, all while you stay informed and connected.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every walk is GPS-tracked, so you can follow along and know exactly where your dog has been. 
            We also send photos and videos during the walk, giving you a glimpse of their adventure and the care we provide. 
            Whether your dog enjoys a short stroll or a longer walk, our goal is to ensure they have a fun, safe, and engaging experience.

        <h2>Drop-In Visits</h2>
        <p>
            Need someone to check in on your furry friend during the day? Our Drop-In Visits are perfect for providing your dog
            with companionship and care while you're away. Whether it’s for 30 minutes or a full hour, we’ll make sure your dog
            gets the attention and love they need.

            During a drop-in, we’ll spend quality time with your dog, engaging in play, offering belly rubs, or just giving them
            company and affection. We can also take care of basic tasks like refilling water and food bowls. Just
            like our walks, we’ll keep you updated with photos and videos so you can see how your pet is doing while you’re out.

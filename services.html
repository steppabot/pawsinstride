        <h2>Drop-In Visits</h2>
        <p>
            Need someone to check in on your furry friend during the day? Our Drop-In Visits are perfect for providing your dog
            with companionship and care while you're away. Whether it’s for 30 minutes or a full hour, we’ll make sure your dog
            gets the attention and love they need.
        </p>
        <p>
            During a drop-in, we’ll spend quality time with your dog, engaging in play, offering belly rubs, or just giving them
            company and affection. We can also take care of basic tasks like refilling water bowls or feeding if needed. Just
            like our walks, we’ll keep you updated with photos and videos so you can see how your pet is doing while you’re out.
        </p>

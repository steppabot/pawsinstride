        <h2>Dog Walking Services</h2>
        <p>
            At Paws in Stride, we provide dog walking services tailored to fit your dog’s energy level and your schedule. 
            Each walk is designed to ensure your dog gets the exercise and attention they need, all while you stay informed and connected.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every walk is GPS-tracked, so you can follow along and know exactly where your dog has been. We also send photos and videos during the walk, 
            giving you a glimpse of their adventure and the care we provide. Whether your dog enjoys a short stroll or a longer walk, 
            our goal is to ensure they have a fun, safe, and engaging experience.
